## Python
[Assimulo](https://jmodelica.org/assimulo/) offers 14 solvers
with good documentation for explicit and implicit problems.

## Julia
- [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/) offers a unified interface to about 150 different solvers for a large range of problems. It wraps many existing solvers, that have been implemented in C++ or Fortran and adds a growing number of native Julia solvers, many of them state-of-the-art.
- [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl)An acausal modeling framework for automatically parallelized scientific machine learning (SciML) in Julia. A computer algebra system for integrated symbolics for physics-informed machine learning and automated transformations of differential equations. 

## Scientific papers
- The paper [Dynamic Model of a Pumping Kite Power System](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6218) describes the tether model used in this tutorial, but also a model of a complete kite power system with experimental validation.
