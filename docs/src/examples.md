## Mass, thrown upwards, then falling
Use the provided script to start Julia from the `Tethers.jl` folder:
```bash
cd repos/Tethers.jl
./bin/run_julia
```
From the Julia prompt, run the simulation:
```julia
include("src/Tether_01.jl")
```
You should see a plot similar to:

![Falling mass](docs/images/FallingMass.png)

This example shows a mass that is thrown upwards, slows down and then falls.

**Julia code:** [Tether_01.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_01.jl)

These differential equations define the model:
```Julia
D = Differential(t)

eqs = vcat(D.(pos) ~ vel,
           D.(vel) ~ acc,
           acc    .~ G_EARTH)
```
The term `D.(pos)` means "Apply the differential D(t) to all elements of the vector `pos`". The second term defines that the differential of the velocity vector must be equal to the 
acceleration. For equality in symbolic equations the character `~` has to be used, because the character `=` has the meaning "assign a value to a variable" which is not what we are doing here. The third equation means that all elements of the acceleration vector must be equal to the elements of the gravity vector. We end up with an array of `3x3`` equations.

The next lines are:
```julia
@named sys = ODESystem(eqs, t)
simple_sys = structural_simplify(sys)
```
This means we create a named ordinary equation system, depending on `t`. Then we simplify the system symbolically (order reduction). If you type `sys` in the Julia REPL (command line) you can see that the original system had 9 equations, the second line above created a system with only six equations. This step helps to speed up the simulation and often also removes algebraic loops which makes the ODE a lot simpler to solve numerically later on.

Now the parameters of the integrator are defined:
```julia
duration = 10.0
dt = 0.02
tol = 1e-6
ts    = 0:dt:duration
```
The time step $dt$ is the interval in which the solution shall be stored, NOT the time step of the integrator. The integrator uses a variable time step which can be much smaller or much larger as determined by the required tolerance, in this example set to $tol=10^{-6}$. The variable $ts$ is a range object defining the sampling times for the result.

In the next lines, we define the ODE problem and finally, we solve it using the Rodas5 solver with the given parameters. The second parameter defines the initial conditions. We use `nothing` here because we defined the initial conditions already in the [model](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/87635d9df32f3ded49d0a394b613b412c2c83d55/src/Tether_01.jl#L7C1-L9C44).
```julia
prob = ODEProblem(simple_sys, nothing, (0.0, duration))
@time sol = solve(prob, Rodas5(), dt=dt, abstol=tol, reltol=tol, saveat=ts)
```
The macro `@time` measures the compilation and execution time of calling the function `solve()`. The function is compiled only when called the first time. 

### Python version as comparison
From the Julia prompt execute:
```
include("src/RunTether.jl")
```
This will install Python, Matplotlib and Assimulo and execute the script `Tether_01.py`.

**Python code:** [Tether_01.py](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_01.py)

If you compare the Python and the Julia scripts you can see that:
- the Julia script is shorter and easier to read
- Julia is about 16 times faster when running the simulation


## Mass, attached to a spring-damper
From the Julia prompt, run the simulation:
```julia
include("src/Tether_02.jl")
```
![Spring damper](docs/images/SpringDamper.png)

Mass, attached to a spring-damper element. One end of the spring is attached at the origin, the second end is attached to the mass. Mass initially below the origin, spring un-stretched. Z-axis pointing
upwards.

**Julia code:** [Tether_02.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_02.jl)

## Mass, with non-linear spring damper
```julia
include("src/Tether_03.jl")
```
![Non-linear Spring damper](docs/images/Nonlinear.png)

Mass, attached to a non-linear spring-damper element. One end of the spring is attached at the origin, and the second end is attached to the mass. Mass initially below the origin, spring un-stretched. Z-axis pointing upwards. 

Initial velocity $4 m/s$ upwards. The compression stiffness is zero. The grey line shows that
the stiffness is zero at the beginning, and has the nominal value at the end. **Example:** [Tether_03.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_03.jl).

Thanks to the package [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/) the system description is very compact and readable:
```Julia
eqs = vcat(D.(pos)      ~ vel,
           D.(vel)      ~ acc,
           norm1        ~ norm(pos),
           unit_vector  ~ -pos/norm1,         # direction from point mass to origin
           spring_vel   ~ -unit_vector â‹… vel,
           c_spring     ~ c_spring0 * (norm1 > abs(l0)),
           spring_force ~ (c_spring * (norm1 - abs(l0)) + damping * spring_vel) * unit_vector,
           acc          ~ G_EARTH + spring_force/mass)
```

The same in Python: **Python code:** [Tether_03.py](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_03.py). 

### Using a callback
By using a callback to detect exactly when the transition from a stiff tether segment to a loose
tether segment happens we can increase the accuracy of the simulation. **Julia code:** [Tether_03b.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_03b.jl).

We only have to add the following lines of code:
```julia
function condition(u, t, integrator) # Event when condition(u,t,integrator) == 0
    norm(u[1:3]) - abs(L0)
end
function affect!(integrator)
    println(integrator.t)            # Not needed, just to show that the callback works
end
cb = ContinuousCallback(condition, affect!)
```
and add the parameter `callback = cb` to the line that calls the solver:
```julia
sol = solve(prob, Rodas5(), dt=dt, abstol=tol, reltol=tol, saveat=ts, callback = cb)
```

### Using a callback with Python
In Python you would have to add the following attribute:
```Python
    sw0 = [vel_1[2] > 0] # array of booleans; true means the tether segment is loose (l < l_0)
```
and the following methods:
```Python
    def state_events(self, t, y, yd, sw):
        """
        This is our function that keeps track of our events. When the sign
        of any of the events has changed, we have an event.
        """
        # calculate the norm of the vector from mass1 to mass0 minus the initial segment length
        event_0 = np.linalg.norm(y[3:6]) - L_0
        return np.array([event_0])
    
    def handle_event(self, solver, event_info):
        """
        Event handling. This functions is called when Assimulo finds an event as
        specified by the event functions.
        """
        state_info = event_info[0] # We are only interested in state events
        if state_info[0] != 0:     # Check if the first event function has been triggered
            if solver.sw[0]:       # If the switch is True the pendulum bounces
                print(solver.t)
```
**Example:** [Tether_03b.py](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_03b.py).  
As you can see, logging of calculated variables is not
possible with Assimulo (easy with ModelingToolkit in Julia). You need to re-calculate them
after the simulation.

## Benchmarking non-linear simulation
Using a callback slows the simulation down, but not much. Try it out:
```julia
include("src/Tether_03c.jl")
```
Output on a fast PC:
```
Solving the system without callback...
  0.000606 seconds (8.06 k allocations: 257.672 KiB)
Press any key...

Solving the system with callback...
  0.000741 seconds (9.93 k allocations: 365.812 KiB)
If you zoom in to the points in time where pos_z crosses -10m
you should see a difference...
```
In this example, the gain of accuracy is very small, but that can be different
in other simulations. For benchmarking we call solve twice: The first call ensures that the
code is compiled, and the second call measures the execution time of the code.

**Python**
The script, which executes the Python code with callbacks:
```
include("src/RunTether_03b.jl")
```
reports 31 ms for solving the problem (without printing).
Without callbacks:
```
include("src/RunTether_03.jl")
```
still, 20 ms are needed.

## Multi-segment tether
Using 2D arrays of variables allows to simulate a multi-segment tether:
```julia
@variables pos(t)[1:3, 1:segments+1]  = POS0
@variables vel(t)[1:3, 1:segments+1]  = VEL0
@variables acc(t)[1:3, 1:segments+1]  = ACC0
```
In this case, it is important to calculate the initial conditions of each particle such that they are physically feasible:
```julia
G_EARTH::Vector{Float64} = [0.0, 0.0, -9.81]    # gravitational acceleration     [m/sÂ²]
L0::Float64 = 10.0                              # initial segment length            [m]
V0::Float64 = 4                                 # initial velocity of lowest mass [m/s]
segments::Int64 = 2                             # number of tether segments         [-]
POS0 = zeros(3, segments+1)
VEL0 = zeros(3, segments+1)
ACC0 = zeros(3, segments+1)
SEGMENTS0 = zeros(3, segments) 
UNIT_VECTORS0 = zeros(3, segments)
for i in 1:segments+1
    POS0[:, i] .= [0.0, 0, -(i-1)*L0]
    VEL0[:, i] .= [0.0, 0, (i-1)*V0/segments]
end
for i in 2:segments+1
    ACC0[:, i] .= G_EARTH
end
for i in 1:segments
    UNIT_VECTORS0[:, i] .= [0, 0, 1.0]
    SEGMENTS0[:, i] .= POS0[:, i+1] - POS0[:, i]
end
```
The first example of such a model is the script [Tether_04.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_04.jl) which is derived from the last example.

## Segmented tether with correct force distribution

In the script [Tether_05.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_05.jl#L61), the spring force is distributed correctly on the two masses attached to the spring as shown here:
```julia
# loop over all tether particles to apply the forces and calculate the accelerations
for i in 1:(segments+1)
    global eqs2; local eqs
    eqs = []
    if i == segments+1
        push!(eqs, total_force[:, i] ~ spring_force[:, i-1])
        push!(eqs, acc[:, i]         ~ G_EARTH + total_force[:, i] / (0.5 * mass))
    elseif i == 1
        push!(eqs, total_force[:, i] ~ spring_force[:, i])
        push!(eqs, acc[:, i]         ~ zeros(3))
    else
        push!(eqs, total_force[:, i] ~ spring_force[:, i-1] - spring_force[:, i])
        push!(eqs, acc[:, i]         ~ G_EARTH + total_force[:, i] / mass)
    end
    eqs2 = vcat(eqs2, reduce(vcat, eqs))
end
```
We loop over the particles. The first and the last particle only one spring force is acting. 
On the other particles two spring forces are acting in the opposite direction. Because the first particle is fixed
we set its acceleration to zero.

**Julia code:** [Tether_05.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_05.jl)
 
**Python code:** [Tether_05.py](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_05.py)

Finally, in this example, we plot the result dynamically as 2D video. Screenshot:

![Tether 2D](docs/images/Tether2d.png)

## Multi-segment tether reeling out
In this example, we assume a constant reel-out speed of $V_{RO}=2m/s$. When reeling out the following values need to be dynamically calculated:
- unstretched length of a tether segment
- mass of the tether segment
- spring constant
- damping constant

We do this in the following way at [line 76ff](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/87635d9df32f3ded49d0a394b613b412c2c83d55/src/Tether_06.jl#L76C1-L79C59):
```julia
length            ~ L0 + V_RO*t 
m_tether_particle ~ mass_per_meter * (length/segments)
c_spring          ~ C_SPRING / (length/segments)
damping           ~ DAMPING  / (length/segments)
```
where `L0` is the unstretched length of the complete tether at $t=0$. 

**Julia code:** [Tether_06.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_06.jl)

The IDA solver, used for Python has a very high numerical damping. Therefore we had to multiply
the damping coefficient with a factor of $0.045$ to achieve a more-or-less realistic result.

**Python code:** [Tether_06.py](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_06.py)

### Refactoring the code, add a Settings struct and splitting it into functions
**Julia code:** [Tether_06b.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_06b.jl).

If you want to have fast code, that can be reused and tested using unit tests, then it is better
to put your code in functions and to avoid global variables. We demonstrate that in this example.

First, the settings are stored in a `struct` type:
```julia
@with_kw mutable struct Settings @deftype Float64
    g_earth::Vector{Float64} = [0.0, 0.0, -9.81] # gravitational acceleration     [m/sÂ²]
    l0 = 50                                      # initial tether length             [m]
    v_ro = 2                                     # reel-out speed                  [m/s]
    d_tether = 4                                 # tether diameter                  [mm]
    rho_tether = 724                             # density of Dyneema            [kg/mÂ³]
    c_spring = 614600                            # unit spring constant              [N]
    damping = 473                                # unit damping constant            [Ns]
    segments::Int64 = 5                          # number of tether segments         [-]
    Î±0 = Ï€/10                                    # initial tether angle            [rad]
    duration = 10                                # duration of the simulation        [s]
    save::Bool = false                           # save png files in folder video
end
```
When defining a `struct` it is good to give a concrete type to each field. Here, we use Float64 as default,
as defined in the first line. Apart from this type we also use the type `Int64` for integer values and `Bool`
for a boolean value.

Then we split the code into the functions:
```julia
function calc_initial_state(se)                          # determine the initial state
function model(se)                                       # create the model
function simulate(se, simple_sys)                        # run the simulation
function plot2d(se, sol, pos, reltime, line, sc, txt, j) # plot the state for one point in time
function play(se, sol, pos)                              # play the simulation result, the solution
function main()                                          # the main program, calling all the other functions
```
The `main()` function looks like this:
```julia
function main()
    se = Settings()
    simple_sys, pos, vel = model(se)
    sol = simulate(se, simple_sys)
    play(se, sol, pos)
end
```

### Using a callback
By using a callback to detect exactly when the transition from a stiff tether segment to a loose
tether segment happens we can increase the accuracy of the simulation. **Julia code:** [Tether_06c.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_06c.jl).

The following lines had to be added:
```julia
local cb
for i in 1:se.segments
    cbi = [norm([pos[1, i+1] - pos[1, i], pos[2, i+1] - pos[2, i], pos[3, i+1] - pos[3, i]]) ~ abs(se.l0)/se.segments]
    if i == 1
        cb = cbi
    else
        cb = vcat(cb, cbi)
    end
end
@named sys = ODESystem(eqs, t; continuous_events = cb)
```

## Segmented tether with aerodynamic drag
In the script [Tether_07.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_07.jl), the tether drag has been added.

The following lines calculate the tether drag force:
```julia
v_app_perp[:, i]   ~ v_apparent[:, i] - (v_apparent[:, i] â‹… unit_vector[:, i]) .* unit_vector[:, i],
norm_v_app[i]      ~ norm(v_app_perp[:, i]),
half_drag_force[:, i] ~ 0.25 * se.rho * se.cd_tether * norm_v_app[i] * (norm1[i]*se.d_tether/1000.0)
```
In the following for loop the spring and drag forces are applied to the particles:
```julia
    for i in 1:(se.segments+1)
        eqs = []
        if i == se.segments+1
            push!(eqs, total_force[:, i] ~ spring_force[:, i-1] + half_drag_force[:, i-1])
            push!(eqs, acc[:, i]         ~ se.g_earth + total_force[:, i] / (0.5 * m_tether_particle))
        elseif i == 1
            push!(eqs, total_force[:, i] ~ spring_force[:, i] + half_drag_force[:, i])
            push!(eqs, acc[:, i]         ~ zeros(3))
        else
            push!(eqs, total_force[:, i] ~ spring_force[:, i-1] - spring_force[:, i] 
                                           + half_drag_force[:, i-1] + half_drag_force[:, i])
            push!(eqs, acc[:, i]         ~ se.g_earth + total_force[:, i] / m_tether_particle)
        end
        eqs2 = vcat(eqs2, reduce(vcat, eqs))
    end
```
If you run the example you can see that the aerodynamic drag adds a lot of damping, the oscillations nearly die out in
about 30s.

## Tether with any endpoints
This example is the same as the last one, but you can freely choose:
- both end-points
- if the end-points are fixed or not

A steady-state solver is used to solve the initial tether shape, based on the endpoints.
If both endpoints are fixed you get a catenary line, deformed by the wind.
This is useful for model verification.

See: [Tether_08.jl](https://github.com/ufechner7/Tethers.jl/blob/main/src/Tether_08.jl)

Two versions of the model are implemented, with the signatures:
```
function model(se; p1=[0,0,0], p2=nothing, fix_p1=true, fix_p2=false)
```
and
```
function model(se, p1, p2, fix_p1, fix_p2, POS0, VEL0, ACC0)
```
The first version calls
- the model with fixed endpoints and zero reel-out speed
- the steady-state solver
- and then the model with the initial positions (POS0) found by the steady-state solver, using the original values of `fix_p1`, `fix_p2` and the original reel-out speed.
